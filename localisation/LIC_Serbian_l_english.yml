 serbia.1.t:0 "The End of Parliament"
 serbia.1.d:0 "Last evening, the city of Belgrade bustled and moved, the people heading home from work and the officials of Parliament wrapping up their assembly. The National Assembly's daily meeting, preceeding the upcoming elections, was quietly interrupted by a stream of men in uniform with rifles and handguns. They ordered members of the assembly to stay in their seats with threat of death if they did not comply. The man leading them, Petar Bojović, holstered his pistol and held his head high to announce the immediate detaining of all members of The National Assembly and the declaration of a strong monarchy to "Save Serbia from socialism." Parliament was escorted out by gunpoint to military trucks and taken to a local police station for an undefined length of time. The building is occupied by a military guard, and it seems all limits on the King's power have vanished overnight."
